                <h1>It Started Out As a Hobby...</h1>
                <p>It all started when I was lost while trying to decide what kind of career I should choose, and one day I decided to stay with what I love most - animals. But because Vet School was too far away and I couldn't move out of my city, I started walking dogs, pet sitting and volunteering at nearby shelters. I found out that I love this kind of work and that I don't have to be a veterinarian to help animals and their owners so I decided to build a company that would focus on those things.</p>
